Hello! September was an exciting month, as we started to enable [the ability to create Quote Posts](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/09/introducing-quote-posts/) on `mastodon.social` and `mastodon.online` (and, they also started to show up on other servers that run nightly builds of Mastodon). Coming to stable releases, very soon now!

## Releases

In September, we made two sets of releases: version [4.4.4](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.4.4) / [4.3.12](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.3.12) / [4.2.25](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.25), followed by version [4.4.5](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.4.5) / [4.3.13](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.3.13) / [4.2.26](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.26). These addressed issues identified with display of quote posts (in v4.4), as well as various other smaller updates and fixes. If you run a Mastodon server, we recommend that you upgrade to the most recent minor update level for your major version.

Looking ahead, we plan to release version 4.5 during October! Expect to see the first beta version in the next few days. After that, we'll start to work on version 4.6 during November; we just [shared our initial thoughts on a Fediverse-friendly format for "Starter Packs"](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/10/our-ideas-about-packs/), which would be a focus in that release.

## Backend and Web

We reviewed and merged 195 Pull Requests (123 with translation and dependency updates removed) from 16 contributors. All three metrics up over August! üöÄ We appreciate the contributions.

<div class="features-list">

## Android

The big changes in September were around Quote Post authoring. We also shipped the 2.11.1 release.

## iOS

We put the finishing touches on 2025.06, which is now available in the App Store. This brings an all-new timeline layout throughout the app, including support for quote posts. This has been a major chunk of work that puts us in a better position to move forward with additional UI improvements from here. We hope you enjoy the new look (and, the bunch of bug fixes made along the way).

## Fediscovery

The [Fediscovery project](https://fediscovery.org) is the initial implementation of a broader specification, [Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers](https://github.com/mastodon/fediverse_auxiliary_service_provider_specifications), aka FASPs.

We‚Äôre happy to see that our friend [James aka @Floppy](https://mastodon.me.uk/@Floppy) has been working on creating a [client / non-provider side implementation of the FASP interface](https://github.com/manyfold3d/fasp_client). In fact, he also added support for federated search based on Fediscovery into [version 0.123.0](https://manyfold.app/news/2025/09/16/release-v0-123-0.html) of [Manyfold](https://manyfold.app/), an application for organising 3D print models that is also part of the Fediverse.

If you‚Äôre interested in Fediscovery - or in creating FASP implementations - then we‚Äôd be curious to know what you‚Äôre working on... üßê

## Community

We have a couple of important discussions to highlight in our GitHub community this month:

- We plan to update our Code of Conduct for the Mastodon community and GitHub projects to the Contributor Covenant, version 3. The [proposal for comment](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions/36324) is open for the next month. Participants in our community look at this discussion, as this is an opportunity to comment on new Code of Conduct.
- We just posted a [community consultation on new Terms of Service](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions/36368) to be applied to the Mastodon servers hosted by Mastodon gGmbH (`mastodon.social` and `mastodon.online`) in the coming month. If you have an account on these servers, please take a look at this.

Apart from these discussions, we love to discover new projects being built on the Mastodon API! üîç

- [Best-o-Masto is a new single-purpose iOS client app](https://birchtree.me/blog/introducing-best-o-masto/) for highlighting the top posts from the people you follow.
- [Feditag](https://github.com/Enichan/feditag) is a JavaScript-based embed to pull in hashtagged posts from a specific Mastodon account, for display on a web page.
