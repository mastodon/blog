We are happy to release our 2024 Annual Report. We're a non-profit, and open-source; we value transparency, and we are committed to informing our users and supporters about how we operate.

Our 2024 was transformative in ways we didn't anticipate, and we wanted to capture the full story before sharing it with you. As you'll see in the report, a *lot* happened in 2024; and 2025 brought along new challenges and accomplishments, which we look forward to sharing with you much sooner this time.

So: what's inside? As always, we've got a lot of numbers, recaps, and details to share! How did we expand our budget? How many additions did we make to our small and ambitious team? What did we achieve, and how did our progress prepare us for the changes that arrived in 2025? You will find answers to questions like these in the report.
