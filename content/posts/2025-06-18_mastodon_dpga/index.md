We're happy to share that today, [Mastodon](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/r/mastodon) was added to the Digital Public Goods Alliance’s [DPG Registry](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/).

A goal of the DPGA is to promote digital public goods in order to create a more equitable world. Being recognised as a DPG increases the visibility, support for, and prominence of open projects that have the potential to tackle global challenges. To become a digital public good, all projects are required to meet the [DPG Standard](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) to ensure that they truly encapsulate open-source principles and what it means to be a digital public good.

Digital public goods are defined as open source software, open standards, open data, open AI systems, and open content collections that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm, and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 2030 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

Mastodon’s mission is to develop the technology and support infrastructure needed to enable a decentralised, interoperable and privacy-first social web. As concerns continue over the centralising power of legacy Big Tech platforms, our status as a recognised digital public good underscores the crucial role our project and software play in fostering democratic online spaces across the web.
