We're happy to share that today, [Mastodon](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/r/mastodon) was added to the Digital Public Goods Alliance’s [DPG Registry](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/).

A goal of the DPGA is to promote digital public goods in order to create a more equitable world. Being recognised as a DPG increases the visibility, support for, and prominence of open projects that have the potential to tackle global challenges. To become a digital public good, all projects are required to meet the [DPG Standard](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) to ensure that they truly encapsulate open-source principles and what it means to be a digital public good.

Digital public goods are defined as open source software, open standards, open data, open AI systems, and open content collections that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm, and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 2030 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

Mastodon’s mission is to ensure that our online social spaces belong to the people forever, and provide a safe place for public discourse. Our vision is an open and safe social internet that encourages everyone to connect, create, feel welcome and be free to dream. As concerns continue over the centralising power of legacy Big Tech platforms, our status as a recognised digital public good underscores the crucial role our project and software play in fostering democratic online spaces across the web.
