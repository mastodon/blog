Last year, we launched our first batch of plushies, and our community has [embraced the #Plushtodon literally and figuratively](https://mastodon.social/tags/plushtodon). It sold out in Europe within a few weeks. Sadly, that means a lot of you missed out on the chance to get one. We’ve listened to your feedback and decided to bring the creature back with a few amendments: Size and color. For the first time, the #Plushtodon will be available in **two flavourful colors, and half the size**, making it much easier to fit within every household or mode of transport, while maintaining the delightful softness and squishiness that it’s come to be known for.

Our plushies are **made in an ICTI Ethical Toy Program and Intertek WCA certified factory in China**, are surface-washable, and are **suitable for children 3+**. The materials are **super soft velboa on the outside, and polyester fiberfill on the inside**. It is worth noting that due to the challenges associated with tariffs in the US, this time, the #Plushtodon will **only be available in Europe** (EU, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK). Like before, there will be a **limited number available**.

**We expect them to go on sale at the end of November**. If you would like to be notified ahead of the public, you can join our merch-specific mailing list below. We only send updates about new merch through it, and your membership helps us gauge interest for future products. Of course, you can also expect us to post about the launch on [our official Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon).
